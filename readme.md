                 HEY GUYS JUST BEGINNING WITH MY NEW PROJECT #YOUTUBE PLAYER.


1. Will be creating a youtube video player app.

2. will be making use of the third party libraries which are coded and developed
   by someone else that can be imported and iused.

3. will be using here the youtube API , a library developed by google to enale 
   android developers like us to play youtube videos in our app.

4. will be using here callbacks and event handling as app will be recieving noti-
   -fications from the youtube API's.

     ===============

1. jst started off today by adding the layout for my app dynamically and also done the
   the setup for the google api key for playing youtube videos in my app.

2. at first found it difficult to get the google api key for the app but steps can be found on 
   google documentation site itself.

3. jst added code for the oninitializefailue method.here i have used googles error dialog to help
   users sort out some of their problems themselves.

   more info on youtubeinitialization result : https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/reference/com/google/android/youtube/player/YouTubeInitializationResult


4. next thing added is code for the oninitializeSuccess method for the app to work smoothly.



       17th june
    ===============

1. jst starting off today by adding listener to the code.

   added two types of listeners: playback event listner and state change listener.

2. these listener are just like interfaces in which we have to implement all the methods provided
   by these.

   and have added toast messages to some of those methods of these interfaces.

3. added code for the various methods like onplaying and onpaused methods and also added listeners to 
   call these in the oninitializesuccess method.

   more on the methods used : https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/reference/com/google/android/youtube/player/package-summary

4. For adding some more functionality to my app adding more activities to my app by using the 
   concept of intents.

5. started by creating the layouts for the the activities and added buttons for both the layout pages.

6. added code for the layouts designed for the app by using the intents.

   INTENTS: It is an abstract description of an operation to be performed.It binds the activities together.
   Usually used to launch the activities in our app.

   eg here i have created video intent and playlist intent.

7. added code for the main activity and created my own intent.

   more info on intents: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html

   for INTENT FILTERS: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html

   for YOUTUBE STANDALONE PLAYER: https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/reference/com/google/android/youtube/player/YouTubeStandalonePlayer

8. dealt with some minor changes to the app by modifying some code in the standalone activity section and
   made the app fully funtionable.





                 

               More modifications coming soon..........
